# Efficient and Robust Multi-Modal Belief Propagation SLAM Using Clusrering-Based Re-Parameterization

Implementation of multi-modal belief propagation using clusrering-based re-parameterization for SLAM back-end

Through this SLAM back-end algorithm, robust and efficient optimization results can be obtained for multi-modal factor graphs including false loop closures in environments where structural ambiguities exist.
